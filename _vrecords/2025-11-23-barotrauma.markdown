# Prologue
I am but a lowly mechanic, stuck listening to the same hum of various submarine hull. Life is plain but boring, days bled into one another, how long has it been since I was in one of these submarines?

One day I was approached by C, he walks around in a expensive peacoat and a revolver. Where he brought me and a electrician and a security officer to a corner, and showed us an relic. Some ancident thing that pulse with a strange overworldly light. Then he shared with us his vision of escaping this godforsaken planet, where we head to where no man has been before. 

I look at our fellow crewmate, D stood in a relaxed slouch, his eyes alert and tracing the wiring around us, whereas J stood upright like a parade rest, projecting an image of professionalism that he clearly wish he was.
It must be C charisma, but I were sold. He had already bought a submarine, the kind popular among upstarts and idiots. Apparently I am feeling stupid today, leaving my fate in the hands of two barely experienced member and a greenhorn.

We start the mission like any upstart would, the most exciting of adventures, delivering shit from point A to point B. Can't go anywhere with no money anyway. It has been so long that I have forgotten my talents, but C reassure us that we will get there in no time.

Not even the third mission is when something went really wrong, since well I don't have much to do when everything is fine, I get to walk around the submarine. J is busy looking into the periscope, C is using that fancy touchscreen to pilot the submarine while D is dealing with the reactor underneath us.

"Contact at 4 o Clock!"

I heard over the radio, any competent gunner would be calling out to the captain, but our gunner is trying to navigate our gun to aim at 4 o Clock, by the time I get over to the gun the monster, a Mud raptor, has beached a hull and gotten into the submarine. I pushed a diving suit and J started putting it on, as I head to the gunnery room I see the mud raptor, with J in its jaws, swim inside. C tried to pull out his revolver, but the barotrauma causes him to implode. I pulled out a diving knife and shove it inside the monster. I take a welding touch and seal the hull of the submarine; J took control of the control of the submarine and docked at the station. Well, it is not like I am out of money to go home.

When we land, I saw the strange light mends the corpse of C and D, then they start to become one again. When they came to, they remembered that they died, but not what happen next. I have no idea what happened, but I am sure this isn’t normal. I went to the arms dealer and got a revolver, usually mechanics don't carry one, but it is now evident that I need one. I returned just in time to see that C has gotten us a brand-new submarine, it is apparently better as he once heard in a magazine. Well, if they are immortal surely there can't be any harm sticking to them a while more, right?
