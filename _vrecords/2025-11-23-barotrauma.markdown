# Log 1

Depth: -1100 meter
Vessel: Dugong

Half the crew died the very first time a monster breach our hull. Well someone screw up I think, apologies I am still trying to process what happened.

It all started one day where a overly excited Captain approach me, claiming to have found an artifacts and we are fated to be together. Now artifacts are something of a rarity, and I couldn't pass up on a chance.

I walked into a room with the Captain, where a Security Officer and an Electrician are here as well. There, the box open and a strange marble clock. Just then, the clock moved and strike 12. At that instant the alien artifact glows brightly and when we came to it vanished.

"You are hearing this right! This is magic!"

"Errr...what is going on!? Captain?"

"Is this supposed to happen? This is my first time seeing one"

I look at the fidgeting Security next to the curious Electrician. the captain is over the moon here.

"Y'all know I have been all the way to the great void, didn't see anything like this"

"Then this is an adventure lets go!"

That is how I found myself the mechanic of the Dugong. We started with some simple transport missions to accumlate some capital. We are in the Cold Carvens, one of the few places on this godforsaken planet that is blooming with life.

"Enemy at 5 O' Clock!"

"I don't see anyone! Captain"

We were attacked by some aquatic life, I rushed to the gunnery room where the Security Officer is manning the top gun, I snatched the periscope attached to the bottom gun and see the enemy. Regrettably I landed two to three hits before it makes a hole in the hull.

"Hull Breach guys! Put on the suit!"

I put on a diving suit and the Security Officer follow suit. Carrying a wrench, I open the door leading to the captain quarters, just in time to see the monster chewing on the electrician corpse. Upon seeing us the monster woobled towards us, using my wrench I press into an open wound, bashing the monster into the ground where it thankfully passed on.

Grabbing a welding gun as I done many times before, I sealed the breached hull in the reactor room, the electrician never stood a chance. As the water drained I walk past the captain, who is now half of what he use to be.

I set the submarine to pilot and head off to repair the submarine, the Security Officer stared at the screen, standing next to the Captain torso. The instant we docked automatically, a strange light form inside the submarine,there it stood, the Captain and Electrician. They move more sluggishly than they did before but they are definetly alive, right beside their corpse.

As the captain declare that the fates won't let us die until the dream is true, I am off to get some Rum. I will either wake up soon or we are stuck on this journey to hell together.
