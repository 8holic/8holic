# Log 2

Depth: -1300 meter
Vessel: Orca

We decided to head right, our goal is the mysterious "eye of europa" after all. I am writing from the Pelorus Linea Habitation Outpost.

Our new submarine comes with a airlock upstairs, and a docking bay both above and below. The electrician decided to make it right and spent some time wiring the bottom airlock. On our first run, I dived out from the bottom to mine some ores. I turn around then realize that he has forgotten to get a back button.

"H did you forget to close the door?"

So the submarine sank to the ocean floor while I get on with it, we soon added to the checklist to get button in pairs

On our way to the objective we attempted a cultist transport objective. We heard some wild things about them, like worshipping the husk, but they appear human enough. Halfway through the mission, where H and J is out on a expedition, we suddendly heard over radio that the captain is bitten. Lacking heavy arnaments they never stood a chance, as we swam back we couldn't find the submarine. It seems under panic the captain has driven away. With our oxygen tank low I look at J and before long we both drowned.

Then we all woke up at the beginning of the mission like nothing happen, the looks in the eye makes it clear everyone remembered what happened. The captain immedeitely stormed the quarter and shoot the cultist and have to be stopped by the electrician. We decide the best way is to get there ASAP before they turn, so that was what we did.

Being able to try again is very nice...through drowning in the diving suit in darkness is painful. Lets try our best to not have that happen again.
