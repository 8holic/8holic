# Introduction
My real name is BRyan,a hobbyist when it come to coding. I started when I was 9 using e-toy to create a turn based game. Unfortunately the project is lost to time in my old laptop. I use the handle 8holic almost exclusively on my online spaces. So on online spaces I would prefer to be referred to my online handle

# Background
While studying in Charles III University of Madrid, an web analytic course inspired me to create an application using what I learnt in class. After that I realize that I have a lot of random projects that is lost to time, so I decided to use what I learnt from the Odin project and googling to create a website.

# Origin of online handle
8 when flipped is suppose to be infinity, where holic meant an addiction. Combined it is suppose to stand for an infinite addiction, not sure to what, but I hope it is to learning. I am very sure totally that this is what my 11 year old self is thinking when he created this handle for me beyond "wow it sounds cool"

# Closing
This website is basically not advertised anywhere, so if you don't know me in real life and somehow come across this website,or even if you do know me in real life, I would be curious to learn how exactly did you get here. Until then I hope you enjoy your stay
