This is as good as a time to introduce myself. My name is Bryan, through I use 8holic on most online spaces.

This is NOT a professional site or portfolio, just a personal journal where I share my thoughts, ideas, and experiences. I might create a professional portfolio in the future, when I have enough achievement to call my own.
I also do not expect this website to be seen that much, github is literally the only place I linked this. So if you are one of the few visitors, I am curious how exactly did you find this place.

#Real Life Background
I am a hobbyist in terms of coding, I started when I was 9 using e-toys. I created some turn based game using the else if statements. Afterwards I was busy with the asian education system, however I seems to have found my bearings in univerisy.
This website can be attributed thanks to the course at Charles III University of Madrid, I was inspired by a professor there to create something I can call my own as well as to collate my projetcs.
Despite spending only one semester there, the impact is much more greater than the courses in my home university with the exception of the undergradute research project.
I learnt web development from the Odin Project, as well as some random projects in C++ and Python.
My first project is under Professor Benjamin guidance, to develop a Virtual Reality application of the school garden before the rennovation. I am not sure if I have permission to share it so just trust me man.
#Online Presence
The name 8 holic is used in most of my online presences, such as github, itch.io, and some game forums. As of how this came about, 8 was supposed to stand for infinity,holic is suppose to be an obession.
Combined I think it stands for infinite addiction to certain things, which is a good description of myself. I am sure this is what my younger self thinks instead of it sounds cool.
I am not very active on social media, I usually browse on reddit.
