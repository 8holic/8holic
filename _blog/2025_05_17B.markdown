Day 3 starts with a rainy day, where I make some changes to my plans instead. It was nice to witness the city in a different weather

# Osaka Aquarium and car museum

The first location I visited was Osaka Aquarium, I have seen it in an anime before so I was kinda curious.

Overall the aquarium was really nice, I paid extra to enter the feeding area. The caretakers are very knowledgeable and speak some english.
Q:All these animals how do they coexist in the same tent
A:We keep the animals well fed, the animals do not attack each other if they are full.
Q:Is this why the divers are safe in these animals
A:Yes, the animals recognize the divers as a food provider.
I also see a few of the divers feeding them and a trainer. The backstage experience is worth the cost if I want to ask questions. Unfortunately I am not a big marine entuaist so I don't have much to ask, however if someone is really curious this is worth the cost.
The rest of the place is well maintained and the envrioment looks exciting. I will go again in the future.

Looking at the map I noticed a old car museum, the Glion Museum. I do like cars, my dad like cars, it is located at this factory like place. I had to do a double take to ensure I arrived at the right location.

The entire place consist of many cars, from the start of transport with horses, to the old cars. Most of the description are in japanese, but it looks pretty nice. It is a small nice museum for an hour or two.

# Umeda Sky

A view of Osaka from Umeda Sky has two distinctive side, one side where the river is visible while the other side is more modern. It was included in the Osaka card and it is worth the short time to have a nice view of Osaka.
There was also an art museum nearby.

# Reflection of Day 3
Day 3 is a lot lighter, but it was a pretty enjoyable experience. I think the highlights is seeing how different nation can do the same thing(like an aquarium) differently and still be enjoyable. Osaka Aquarium is definetly the highlight and I learn a bit about marine life. Umeda Sky is a nice overview of Osaka.
