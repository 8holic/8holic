On day 4, with the great weather, I decided its time to push the button. Tomogashima Island ahve been of interest since I saw it in some anime, also abandoned places are kinda my thing so I went ahead with this. I booked a ferry at 0900, so I got up early, ate the cup noodles I made a few days ago and too the train.

There is a convenient train towards Kada town, where I have to walk to the harbor. It feels like a quiet Japanese town, very different from the Osaka city

During the morning, the ship was delayed and potentially cancelled. I was worried but an hour later it was fine and the boat went ahead.

The island I visit was a former world war 2 defense port. There is no local population, I went past a few abandoned buildings. I met a new friend over here, we still talk occasionally. It was an exciting hike, through the right side is sealed off for safety reason. I walked most of the island.

I actually miss the ferry back, it was kinda too full. I spoke to my new friends and they are much older than me. I guess most people my age don't have the money or the recklessness to commit to a solo trip. Through I panic for a moment I did learn to go with the flow.

# Day 3 reflection
Since those two is of privacy minded I can't put this online.
