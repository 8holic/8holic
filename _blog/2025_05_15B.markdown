# Background
In Singapore there is very strong japanese cultural influence, Doeramon plays here every Saturday, recently I found out about a budget airline. I decided to go on this trip to prepare for my long term exchange in europe. I find it suitable as Japan doesnt have english as its main language and is more affordable as well.

As a student I had cup noodle frequently, Japanese cup noodles are always more expensive and considered prenium. So of course I had to visit the cup noodles. Over here I even get to make a cup noodle. Seeing the full process is intresting. The process is roughly as following:
1. Place the instant noodle as well as the ingreidents
2. Lid sealers are used that press a foil that stick to the cup.

Very near to the cup noodle factory, this park exist. I decided to pay it a visit as there isnt much time. I thought it was beautiful, I visited the remnants of a castle and had a view of the city. This spot was far away from the city, suprising I notice there was a wheelchair friendly features at this park.

I walked around Dotonbori, it was really crowded. I visited a few stores and had aomse Takoyaki and it is better than anything in Singapore. Suprising they have a Chinese menu as well, through it did not help because I cannot read Chinese.

# Day 1 Reflection
Day 1 marks when I settle down, I stayed at a hostel where we each have our own room and a shared common area. I visited a few places and enjoyed myself.
