# Day 2 Standout
Today was a busy day, in the morning I will be visiting Osaka Castle, while in the evening and night I am visiting the Osaka World Expo. My professor did mention this and shown a few videos, since then I have been curious about it.

As a student I had cup noodle frequently, Japanese cup noodles are always more expensive and considered prenium. So of course I had to visit the cup noodles. Over here I even get to make a cup noodle. Seeing the full process is intresting. The process is roughly as following:
1. Place the instant noodle as well as the ingreidents
2. Lid sealers are used that press a foil that stick to the cup.

# Day 1 Reflection
Day 1 marks when I settle down, I stayed at a hostel where we each have our own room and a shared common area. I visited a few places and enjoyed myself.
