### Background
As a student heading for exchange, I decided to do a trip in europe since I haven't really travel outside of Asia. I decided on Italy due to its relative close proximity to my exchange university in Spain.

# Milan - Standout Moments

## First impressions
Upon arrival the first thing I noticed is that the buildings seems older. There isn't lots of skyscraper, most buildings are quite old

## Duomo di Milano
Milan's Cathedral was the first location I visited, it looks pretty old. I really enjoyed looking at the various status around it, going inside I see the pillars and decorations. It is the first time I am seeing such a detailed cathedral. 

The interior is very spacious. I sat down and just enjoyed the enviroment, it is very quiet.

I climbed to the rooftop,it was a tough climb. A few hundred steps, I didn't take the elevator. The view of the city is nice, it feels like a older city.

## Wandering Around

I came across this layout of the city, and it is suprising. I have never seen this before, it feels intresting to see these maps and think of why they were built in the past

The next thing I noticed is the existance of these water fountain. In Singapore these are rare and inconvenient, I cannot believe that these are just out here. I drank a bit and the water was really refreshing.

## Museo del Duomo di Milano

In the museum they talk about the history of the cathedral, it is quite intesting. I saw how they built the cathedral up over time. I went to a few museum so I am just going to group them together, the above image is that of a clock. It has always just worked I have never thought about how such a simple clock works all the time.

This was a pretty creepy underground area, It was an intresting experience walking underground.

## Final thoughts

The first day impression started with a robbery on the train, but overall it was pretty exciting. I felt thrusted in a foreign world, everything is new and exciting.

Through the most challanging part was when the hotel cancel on me as i board the flight, booking on the plane causes me a bit of anxiety but it is good it works out.
