I had something intresting from the supermarket, fried noodles on bread. Like hot dog. Looks weird but it taste ok, probabl wont eat again in the future

This time I am visiting Ikoma Sanjo Amusement Park, before going to Nara. I saw this location and was interested in visiting it.

Ikoma Sanjo Amusement Park is free to enter, where I pay for the rides I took. Being located at the top of the mountain also means there is some nice sights.

One cuorsity is the "White house". When I went initally there wasn't anyone, so I wandered around a bit before returning. The white house in question consist of various part of american history, starting with all the past president.

The founding myth is depicted with a bridge, also certain rooms are tilted a few degrees. Afterwards they depict the steam age with a vaccum cleaner in the background, and a train, the side simulating a train ride. Near the end the moon landing was depicited with a lego toy on a string.

It felt like a intresting view of america. I also took a few rides, one was a looping airplane. The view of the city was really nice, since it is located between Nara and Osaka

The hike down was non eventful, I saw a few shrines through. A sign promise a path to a waterfall, however the mountain was really steep so I did not bother. The numbers of stairs is just absurd.

Nara is known for its deers, through I wasn't prepared for how hostile they are. I got some deer biscuit, and some deer just arrive and rip the entire package. They ended up on the floor and I got a sight of the deer competing to eat it.
