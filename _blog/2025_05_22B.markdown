# What I think went well

## A general plan exist and is followed
For the entire trip I had a general idea of what I wanted to do. Quite a lot of time is spent researching this, there are even slotable in case an event cannot happen because bad weather. I think the plan also means that I get to rest at the end of the day.

## Adaptability to the circumstances
I think I left enough room that I can improvise if something catch my interest. The activties are general enough that I can spent a few hours chilling in Nara Park.

# What I think can be improved

## Trying new things
The whole point of going overseas is to try new food and stuff
