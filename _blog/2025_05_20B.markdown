At 12am I went to hike the Fushimi Inari Shrine, I heard that this location is very busy in the day. So I decided to visit it at night. It has a completely different atmosphere, a little overworldly.

In kyoto I went to the train museum, at one segment I can pilot a toy train with a camera front looking. That was really cool

At the end I went and oversee the city, it is very urban. TBH I didn't really feel much, the Hibike collab was nice through. i liked that show. I got a coaster.
