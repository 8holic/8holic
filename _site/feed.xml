This is the first ever post. I am writing as 8Holic</p>

<p>Initally I wanted a hub page to link all my different projects, however I learnt of Jekyll and decide to learn how it works. As a side effect this blog is created.</p>

<p>For the time being I don’t have much to link yet, through the objective is the following
-The Home page,which will consist exerpts of the other part<br />
-The about page<br />
-The blog page<br />
-All projects link<br />
The projects should include both python and terminal line games to downloadable programs.</p>

<p>Here is to hoping this blog survives!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="thoughts" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! This is the first ever post. I am writing as 8Holic]]></summary></entry></feed>
