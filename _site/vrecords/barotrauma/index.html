  <p>To briefly introduce barotrauma is a 2D survival side scrolling game, that takes place in a Submarine.</p>

<p>Characters<br />
============<br />
H the Mechanic<br />
D the Electrician<br />
C the Captain<br />
J the Security Officer<br /></p>

<h1 id="prologue">Prologue</h1>
<p>I am but a lowly mechanic, stuck listening to the same hum of various submarine hull. Life is plain but boring, days bled into one another, how long has it been since I was in one of those vessels?</p>

<p>One day I was approached by C, he walks around in a expensive peacoat and a revolver. Where he brought me and a electrician and a security officer to a corner, and showed us an relic. Some ancident thing that pulse with a strange overworldly light. Then he shared with us his vision of escaping this godforsaken planet, where we head to where no man has been before.</p>

<p>At that moment his words touched my heart, and without knowing the others, I agreed and onboard the submarine I went.</p>

<p>The first few missions are simple mining and discovery mission, many people needs their goods from point A to point B. As the mechanic I get to walk around the ship until things go to hell, C is busy with the brand new touchscreen nagivation system, while D is underneath us managing the reactor. I walk pass J, concentrated into the periscope looking above the submarine.</p>

<p>A single mistake, that is all it took for things to go to hell.
“4 O Clock contact!”
I walk into the gunnery room to see that J is busy fiddling the top gun, trying to get it to aim down. Taking control over the bottom gun, I landed a few hits before I witness the monster breach a hole into a submarine. At the very instant I hear the gushing of water, and I put on a diving suit while J mimiced what I did. Moments later, the monster swim into the gunnery room. Grabbing a wrench from my toolbelt, I bashed the injured monster sending it flinging in the water.</p>

<p>Once I fixed the hull breach with the welding torch, the ballast tanks started working. Where the water clear I saw that C is left with his torso, D didn’t stand a chance,being the closest to the breach. It is no time to mourn, as I pick up a screwdriver and start fiddling with the wiring, the submarine started to move up. I climbed up and see J fiddling with the controls like he is being guided.</p>

<p>Before I could head over, he docked the submarine,where a strange light glows across the submarine. I see C and D being magically reformed at the nagivation room.
“…”
They glance at me, all of us staring at each other.
“So, those voices in my head guiding me, it was the two of you?”
This is the only possible explination, someone who never driven a submarine before can complete the docking protocol.
“Well we found we can kinda wander around the submarine and talk to you guys”</p>

<p>After a while we establish that nobody know what is going on, through I am not keen on testing C “relic revival theory”. I headed up the station and bought a revolver, clearly I am going to need it. Meanwhile C went ahead and bought a new submarine for the crew, I am sure it comes with the skills to not die as well. Regardless it seems I will be here for a while.</p>
